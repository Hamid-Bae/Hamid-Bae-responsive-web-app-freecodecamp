            <p>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).</p>
            <p>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
                <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
                <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</p>
            <p>However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example. (Hello world! is the standard for introductory programming examples.)</p>
            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you haven't been following along with the rest of our course, download this example code and use it as a starting point.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Go to your test site and create a new folder named <code>scripts</code>. Within the scripts folder, create a new file called <code>main.js</code>, and save it.</li>
                <li>In your <code>index.html</code> file, enter this code on a new line, just before <p></body></p> the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag:p</li>
